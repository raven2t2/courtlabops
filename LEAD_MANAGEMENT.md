# Lead Management Rules

**Updated:** 2026-02-08 10:00 ACDT

## Lead Data Requirements

**Each lead MUST include:**
1. **Club name** (full official name)
2. **Role/Contact** (Head Coach, Operations Manager, GM, etc.)
3. **Specific fit reason** - What makes THIS club/person perfect for CourtLab
   - No generic outreach
   - Personalized anchor points (partnerships, programs, pain points)

**Example:**
- ❌ BAD: "Forestville Eagles - basketball club in SA"
- ✅ GOOD: "Forestville Eagles - NBL1 powerhouse, Zane connection (warm intro), runs high-performance youth programs, needs verified player tracking for 60+ teams"
