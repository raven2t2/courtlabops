## Geographic & Seasonal Considerations

- (BID HIGH during these months)

## Search Intent Classification

### PROBLEM-AWARE (High Conversion Intent)
Users searching for solutions to a known problem:

- basketball combine timer (pain: need accurate timing)
- combine times tracker (pain: spreadsheets don't work)
- basketball stats app (pain: manual tracking is slow)
- basketball coach app (pain: managing players is hard)

**CPA Potential:** $15-30 (Highest)
**Bid Strategy:** Bid premium; these are gold.

---

### SOLUTION-AWARE (Medium Conversion Intent)
Users know the solution type but shopping around:

- best basketball training app
- basketball coaching app (generic)
- basketball app like homecourt
- basketball video analysis app

**CPA Potential:** $25-40 (Medium)
**Bid Strategy:** Competitive bids; win on messaging/price.

---

### PRODUCT-AWARE (Lower Conversion Intent)
Users searching for specific competitors:

- homecourt alternative
- sideline basketball app
- coach's eye alternative

**CPA Potential:** $30-50 (Lower)
**Bid Strategy:** Bid lower; use for retargeting/comparison messaging.

---

## Negative Keywords (What to Avoid)

These keywords attract non-converting traffic; exclude them from campaigns:

```
-free
-youtube
-nba
-highlights
-live stream
-video streaming
-college basketball (unless targeting coaches recruiting)
-basketball news
-basketball scores
-betting
-fantasy
```

**Why:** These searchers aren't looking to download a coaching/training app; they want content or gambling. Low intent = high waste.

## Integration with App Store Optimization (ASO)

### App Store Keyword Field (iOS App Store Connect)

**Recommended:**
```
basketball trainer, combine timer, basketball stats, player development, coaching app, basketball analytics, verified times
```

---

### App Store Description Front-load Keywords
Use highest-intent keywords from this research in opening paragraph:

**Recommendation:**
> "CourtLab Basketball Trainer: Verified combine times, player stats, and development tracking for coaches across Australia. Stop guessing—measure with accuracy."

---

### Screenshot Captions Should Echo Keyword Intent

If researching "basketball combine timer" converts well:
- Screenshot 1 should be: "Verify Combine Times" (not just "Measure Performance")

If "basketball coach app australia" converts well:
- Marketing should say "Built for Australian Basketball" (not generic "coaching tool")

---

## Research Methodology

**Data Sources:**
1. Apple Search Ads Keyword Planner (built-in tool)
2. Competitor keyword analysis (via App Store)
3. Basketball Australia community research (combines, clubs)
4. Google Trends (AU region) + Reddit r/Basketball discussions
5. App Store search auto-suggestions (proxy for real searches)
6. Industry benchmarks (AppTweak, StoreMaven)

**Confidence Level:** Medium (no access to live App Store search data, estimates based on comparable markets + industry benchmarks)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Week 1:** Validate keyword performance in ASA (which actually convert?)
2. **Week 2-4:** Double down on winners; pause losers
3. **Month 2:** Expand to 40-50 keywords based on performance
4. **Quarter 2:** Add state-specific + hyper-local AU keywords
5. **Ongoing:** Monitor competitor keyword changes; adapt strategy

---

## Key Takeaway

Australian basketball coaches are searching for:
1. **Accurate combine timing** (not AI guesses)
2. **Affordable coaching tools** (HomeCourt's $200/year is a pain point)
3. **Local solutions** (built in Australia, understands AU basketball)

CourtLab's competitive advantage in ASA is to **dominate the "basketball combine timer" and "combine times tracker" keywords** — these are high-intent, low-competition, and perfectly aligned with CourtLab's core feature.

**Budget allocation recommendation:** 60% of ad spend on combine/timing keywords, 25% on stats/player development, 15% on competitive/comparison keywords.
