## Adam Lyttle's ASO Framework

### Background
- Made **$800K** building 30+ apps with **$0 budget**
- Portfolio approach: Build fast, launch, test market
- Core strategy: Find **low competition + decent volume** keywords

### Key Methodology

**1. Keyword Validation Process**

Uses **AppFigures Keyword Inspector** to evaluate:
- **Popularity:** Search volume (5 = 1-5 downloads/month, 26 = viable market)
- **Competitiveness:** How hard to rank (want LOW competition)
- **Results Count:** Number of apps targeting keyword

**Critical Insight:**  
> "Add the keyword to your title, subtitle and description" — Adam Lyttle

**Example from Sodium Tracker app research:**
- Keyword: "Sodium Tracker"
- iOS: Pop 26, Comp 40, Results 27 ✅ GOOD
- Google Play: Pop 26, Comp 14, Results 250 ✅ EVEN BETTER
- "Sodium Counter": Pop 5, Comp variable — ❌ AVOID (too low volume)

**Key Finding:** Google Play can be "gamed" easier than App Store with standard SEO

---

### 2. Competitive Analysis Framework

**Steps:**
1. Search target keyword in App Store
2. Analyze top 10 results:
   - How many explicitly target keyword?
   - What's their rating count? (proxy for downloads)
   - How old is the app?
   - What's the UI/UX quality?

**Red Flags (Opportunities):**
- Apps with 0 new ratings (declining)
- Old apps (11+ years) with dated UI
- Apps requiring arrows/instructions to use (poor UX)
- Cheap pricing ($3.99 one-time vs subscription)

**Example:**
- "Sodium Tracker" app (11 years old, 0 new ratings) ranked #4
- Adam's conclusion: "We should be able to rank in top 5 with minimal effort"

---

### 3. Pricing Strategy Insights

**Observations from research:**
- Old app: $5.99 one-time purchase ("dirt cheap")
- Newer competitor: $15.99/year or $2.69/month subscription
- Subscription > one-time purchases for long-term revenue

**For CourtLab:**
- Current model likely subscription-based (verify)
- Price competitively vs HomeCourt, Ballogy

---

### 4. Feature Competitive Analysis

**What Adam looks for:**
- Core feature parity (table stakes)
- Unique differentiators (competitive moats)
- Usability gaps (opportunities to excel)

**Example from Sodium Tracker:**
- Old app had arrows pointing to UI elements (usability fail)
- Confusing for non-technical users (elderly, health-conscious)
- Opportunity: Build simpler, cleaner UX

**For CourtLab:**
- Verified data = unique differentiator ✅
- "No AI guesswork" = clear positioning ✅
- Need to assess: Is UI simpler than HomeCourt/Ballogy?

## Competitor Analysis: HomeCourt, Ballogy

### HomeCourt (by NEX/Nike)

**Positioning:**
- "The Future of basketball training"
- Heavy AI/ML branding
- Backed by Nike (credibility + funding)

**Strengths:**
- Brand recognition (Nike)
- Advanced AI features
- Likely high marketing budget

**Weaknesses (CourtLab opportunities):**
- AI can be inaccurate (CourtLab's "no AI" positioning attacks this)
- Potentially over-complicated for casual users
- May require specific setup/equipment

**Keywords Targeting:**
- "basketball training"
- "basketball app"
- "shooting trainer"
- Focus: AI, automation, advanced features

---

### Ballogy (AI Skills Training)

**Positioning:**
- "Personal basketball coach"
- "Track stats and enhance footwork, ball handling"
- "Automatic shot detection"

**Strengths:**
- 100+ drills created by pro players/coaches
- Gamification (leaderboards, points, rewards)
- Personalized practice plans

**Weaknesses (CourtLab opportunities):**
- Generic "AI" positioning (everyone says this now)
- Focus on drills/workouts vs verified combine data
- May not emphasize objective measurement

**Keywords Targeting:**
- "basketball training"
- "basketball skills"
- "basketball drills"
- "sports training"

---

## CourtLab Competitive Positioning (Based on Research)

### Unique Angles CourtLab Can Own

**1. "Verified Data" vs "AI Guesswork"**
- HomeCourt/Ballogy lean on AI
- CourtLab attacks: "No AI, just truth"
- Pain point: Coaches distrust unverified phone timers

**2. "Combine-First" vs "Drill-First"**
- Competitors focus on training content (drills, workouts)
- CourtLab focuses on measurement (combine times, objective progress)
- Different use case: Evaluation vs Training

**3. "Adelaide-Made for Australian Coaches"**
- Localization advantage
- Trust factor: Built by local coach/dad who understands SA basketball
- Easter Classic, local club endorsements

**4. "Become Undeniable"**
- Motivational, outcome-focused tagline
- vs HomeCourt's "Future" or Ballogy's "Elevate"
- More personal, less corporate

**Reasoning:**
- "Basketball Training" = primary keyword

- "Verified" = unique positioning
- "Combine" = niche keyword
- "Film" = secondary feature

### Keywords (iOS, 100 chars backend)
basketball,training,shooting,tracker,combine,timer,stats,coach,performance,vertical,jump,test,drills,adelaide,sa

### Description (First 3 Lines Critical)

**Optimized Opening:**

## Key Takeaways

1. **Adam Lyttle's Core Principle:** Find keywords with decent volume + low competition, then explicitly target them in title/subtitle/description

2. **Google Play is Easier to Game:** Standard SEO works better on Android vs iOS

3. **Competitor Weaknesses = CourtLab Opportunities:**
   - HomeCourt/Ballogy rely on AI (CourtLab attacks with "verified")
   - They focus on drills (CourtLab focuses on measurement)
   - They're US-centric (CourtLab owns Australian localization)

4. **Screenshots Matter More Than Features:**
   - First 2-3 screenshots determine download decision
   - Benefit-driven captions > UI screenshots
   - Social proof (coaches, clubs) builds trust

5. **ASO is Continuous, Not One-Time:**
   - Monitor competitors monthly
   - Update keywords based on performance
   - A/B test quarterly
   - Respond to reviews daily
