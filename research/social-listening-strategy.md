# CourtLab Social Listening & Warm Outreach Strategy

## Overview
Use Twitter/X (bird CLI) and Reddit to:
1. **Find affiliate prospects** (basketball coaches, trainers, content creators)
2. **Find target customers** (clubs, parents, players, associations)
3. **Monitor when they're "warm"** (engaged, posting about relevant topics)
4. **Reach out with tailored DMs** (not spam — genuine value-first engagement)

## PART 1: AFFILIATE PROSPECTING (Twitter/X)

### Search Queries to Run Daily

#### Australian Basketball Coaches/Trainers
```bash
bird search "basketball coach Adelaide" -n 20
bird search "basketball training Australia" -n 20
bird search "basketball skills coach" -n 20
bird search "youth basketball coach" -n 20
bird search "basketball development" -n 20
```

#### Basketball Content Creators
```bash
bird search "basketball tips" -n 20
bird search "basketball drills" -n 20
bird search "basketball training video" -n 20
bird search "basketball content creator" -n 20
bird search "basketball influencer" -n 20
```

#### Parent/Player Communities
```bash
bird search "my son basketball" -n 20
bird search "my daughter basketball" -n 20
bird search "basketball parent" -n 20
bird search "basketball tryouts" -n 20
bird search "basketball club" -n 20
```

### Warm Signals to Watch For

An affiliate prospect is **WARM** when they:
- ✅ Post about basketball training/coaching regularly
- ✅ Share frustration with current tools/methods
- ✅ Ask questions about player development
- ✅ Share success stories of athletes they coach
- ✅ Post about upcoming camps/clinics
- ✅ Engage with basketball content (likes, retweets)
- ✅ Have 1K-50K followers (micro-influencer sweet spot)

### Red Flags (Skip These)
- ❌ Only posts motivational quotes (no actual coaching content)
- ❌ No engagement on posts (bot followers)
- ❌ Only promotes products (pure affiliate spam)
- ❌ Controversial/off-brand content
- ❌ <100 followers (too early) or >500K (unreachable)

## PART 2: TARGET CUSTOMER PROSPECTING

### Basketball Clubs & Associations
```bash
bird search "basketball club Adelaide" -n 20
bird search "basketball association" -n 20
bird search "district basketball" -n 20
bird search "basketball trials" -n 20
bird search "basketball registration" -n 20
```

### Tournament Organizers
```bash
bird search "basketball tournament" -n 20
bird search "basketball carnival" -n 20
bird search "basketball showcase" -n 20
bird search "basketball event" -n 20
```

### Warm Signals for Customers

A club/organization is **WARM** when they:
- ✅ Post about upcoming tryouts/registration
- ✅ Share frustration with current systems/tools
- ✅ Ask for recommendations on training/coaching
- ✅ Post about player development challenges
- ✅ Share tournament/event announcements
- ✅ Engage with basketball technology content

## PART 3: TAILORED DM OUTREACH TEMPLATES

### Template 1: Coach/Trainer (Value-First)
```
Hey [Name], saw your post about [specific thing they posted]. 

Love the work you're doing with young athletes. 

Quick question — are you using any tech to track player development, or still old-school clipboard style?

Either way, respect the grind. Just curious what tools coaches are finding useful these days.

— Michael
CourtLab
```

**Why it works:**
- References specific post (shows you actually looked)
- Compliment their work (flattery)
- Asks opinion (people love giving advice)
- No pitch (builds trust first)
- Short (respects their time)

---

### Template 2: Content Creator (Collaboration Angle)
```
Hey [Name], your basketball content is solid — especially the [specific video/post].

We're running verified combines across Adelaide (think NBA combine for grassroots). QR-based tracking, live leaderboards, the works.

Would love to have you check one out — content gold for your channel, and we can cross-promote your stuff to our athlete network.

No pressure, just thought it might be a fit.

— Michael
CourtLab
```

**Why it works:**
- Specific compliment (shows engagement)
- Clear value proposition (content gold)
- Mutual benefit (cross-promotion)
- Low pressure (no hard sell)

---

### Template 3: Club/Organization (Problem-Solution)
```
Hi [Name], saw your post about [registration/tryouts/event].

Quick question — how are you currently tracking player development data across your program? 

We've been working with clubs on verified combine systems (vertical, agility, shooting) — gives coaches objective data and parents love the transparency.

Not sure if it's a fit for [Club Name], but happy to share how other clubs are using it if you're curious.

— Michael
CourtLab
```

**Why it works:**
- References their post (context)
- Asks about current process (pain point discovery)
- Soft pitch (not aggressive)
- Social proof (other clubs using it)
- Easy out (not pushy)

## PART 4: REDDIT STRATEGY

### Subreddits to Monitor

- r/sports

### Search Queries

```

### Reddit Engagement Rules
1. **Never post links immediately** — engage first, build karma
2. **Answer questions** — be helpful without pitching
3. **Share experiences** — "We tried X and found Y"
4. **DM warm leads** — only after they've engaged with your comments
5. **Create value posts** — "How we track player development" (soft pitch at end)
