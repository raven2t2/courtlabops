As a basketball dad and coach in Adelaide, I know firsthand how hard it is to find tools that actually work for local clubs.\n\nI built CourtLab (courtlab.app) to solve that — pro-grade stat tracking and video tools without the Silicon Valley bloat or price tag.\n\nI'd love to explore a partnership:\n- Free Pro account for you to try\n- {{commissionStructure}} for every coach/club you refer\n- Co-marketing opportunities (case studies, content collab)\n\nNo pressure — if it's not a fit, no worries. Just thought your audience would genuinely benefit.\n\nWorth a conversation?\n\nMichael Ragland\nFounder, CourtLab\nmichael@courtlab.app"
