# Lead Approval Standard — Quality Checklist

**Effective:** 2026-02-08  
**Rule:** Every lead in approval queue must be **100% ready to send**. No drafts. No previews. No exceptions.

## What "Ready to Send" Means

### For DM Leads (Twitter, Instagram)
✅ **MUST HAVE:**
- [ ] Full message written (not preview/snippet)
- [ ] Personalized with 2-3 specific details from research
- [ ] Pain-first or value-first angle (not salesy)
- [ ] Natural tone (conversational, not corporate)
- [ ] Clear CTA (partnership, free trial, demo, etc.)
- [ ] Signature line (Michael, CourtLab, link)
- [ ] Direct link to their account (opens in new tab)
- [ ] "Copy to Clipboard" button works

**Character count:** Twitter DMs up to 10K chars (keep under 500)

**Example:**
```
Hey @bouncepassau,

Been following your content on basketball.com.au for a while. 
Your approach to basketball coverage is exactly what the community needs.

I built CourtLab because I got tired of apps that didn't work for 
local clubs. We help coaches automate player development tracking — 
verified data instead of guesswork.

Your audience would dig this. Thought about a content partnership? 
We could give you exclusive data stories from Easter Classic 2026 combines.

Not asking for anything yet — just thought you'd find it interesting.

- [ ] Clear CTA (demo, quick call, etc.)
- [ ] Signature (Michael, Founder, CourtLab, link)

Subject: South Adelaide Panthers + CourtLab Partnership — Player Development Infrastructure

Hi [Secretary Name],

Saw that REDARC extended their partnership with your Hoops & Her program 
for another 3 years — that's a huge vote of confidence in what you're 
building for women's basketball in SA.

I'm Michael from CourtLab, an Adelaide-based startup built by a local 
coach/dad who got tired of glitchy, expensive apps. We help clubs 
automate shooting stats and player film so coaches save time and 
players get verified data to "Become Undeniable."

Given your focus on pathways and player development with Hoops & Her, 
thought CourtLab might be a fit. Founding Club rate: $2,450/year 
(limited to first 10 SA clubs).

Worth a quick look?

### For Reddit/Comment Leads
✅ **MUST HAVE:**
- [ ] Full comment written (not suggestion/outline)
- [ ] Answers their question FIRST (value-first)
- [ ] Mentions CourtLab naturally (not forced)
- [ ] Link to free trial or app store
- [ ] Tone: helpful peer, not marketer
- [ ] No pressure language
- [ ] "Copy to Clipboard" button works

**Word count:** 50-150 words (concise)

**Example:**
```
Great question! Most apps are either expensive ($100+/year) or unreliable 
(AutoML nonsense). The best ones focus on verified data, not AI hype.

We built CourtLab exactly for this use case — verified combine baselines, 
parent progress reports, zero guesswork. Free tier + Pro at $99/year.

Free to try: courtlab.app

Good luck with your kid's improvement! Feel free to DM if you want more details.
```

- [ ] References their specific post (quote or mention detail)
- [ ] Provides genuine value/insight

- [ ] Tone: peer/expert, not salesperson
- [ ] "Copy to Clipboard" button works

**Word count:** 280 characters max (Twitter limit)

**Example:**
```
This. The admin overhead is why a lot of good coaches burn out.

We automated ours and saved 2+ hours/week. Might be worth a look.

## Examples of What NOT to Do

❌ **Preview only:**
```
"Hey @bouncepassau, Love your content on basketball.com.au..."
(This is a preview. Full message needed.)
```

❌ **Generic angle:**
```
"Hey [name], I've been following your content. I think CourtLab 
could be interesting for your audience."
(No specific detail about their work or pain point.)
```

❌ **Missing signature:**
```
"Hey, want to check out our app?"
(No name, company, link. Looks spammy.)
```

❌ **No CTA:**
```
"I think you'd like CourtLab because it helps with basketball."
(What should they do? Book a call? Try free? Unclear.)
```

---

## Standards Enforcement

**Every lead I submit to you will meet 100% of these standards.**

If you see something that doesn't:
- Missing full message? → I revise immediately
- Generic angle? → I revise immediately
- No research detail? → I revise immediately

**Goal:** You click approval → copy message → paste → send. Takes 30 seconds per lead.
