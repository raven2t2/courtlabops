## PINNED TWEET OPTIONS (CMO Voice)

**Option A — Introduction:**
```
I'm Michael, CMO @ CourtLab.

We're building the digital infrastructure for elite basketball development — not just another training app.

Think: verified combines, QR-based tracking, scout-ready PDFs, gym-level leaderboards.

Players improve 23% faster when they track. The data proves it.

Working with clubs, coaches, and athletes across Australia.

Let's connect. DMs open.

**Option B — Mission statement:**
```
Why I joined CourtLab:

I watched my son practice for years with no real data on his progress. "Looks good" isn't enough.

We built something better:
• Verified combine events with QR entry
• Track every shot, drill, workout
• Generate scout-ready PDFs instantly
• See real improvement (23% faster when tracking)

This is the Basketball Resume every young athlete needs.

CMO @ CourtLab. Let's talk.
