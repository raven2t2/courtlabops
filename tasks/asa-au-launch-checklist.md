## NOTES

**Critical Success Factors:**
1. App must be live on App Store AU (verify first)
2. App Store listing must be updated (subtitle, keywords, description)

4. Keywords must be adjusted weekly based on CTR/CPA
5. Budget must be available ($1,000-1,500/day for 2+ months)

**Risk Mitigation:**
- If CPA trends high: Reduce budget, pause Ad Group 3, focus on high-intent

- If App Store ranking not improving: Increase description optimization, add reviews

**Success Looks Like (Month 1):**
- 50+ installs from ASA
- CPA trending toward $25-30
- CTR improving from 0.91% → 5-8%
- App appearing in top keywords (organic)
