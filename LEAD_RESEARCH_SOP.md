## Research Templates by Lead Type

### SA Club Email
```
Subject: [Club Name] + CourtLab Partnership — Player Development Infrastructure

Hi [Secretary Name],

[Personalized opener based on research:]
- "Saw you run the Easter Classic — biggest tournament in SA"
- "60+ district teams is serious scale"
- "Your Hoops & Her program is impressive"
- "NBL1 team with pro player pipeline"

[Specific problem:]
Volunteer coaches managing stats manually takes hours. No consistent language.

[Solution + fit:]
CourtLab automates it. Three taps:
1. Check attendance
2. Tag skills worked on
3. Done — parents get weekly update

[Social proof / urgency:]

### Affiliate DM
```
Hey [name],

Been following your content on [platform] for a bit. Your post about 
[specific content] hit different — [why it resonates].

I built CourtLab because I got tired of basketball apps that don't work. 
No AI guesswork. Just verified data.

Your audience [specific reason they'd benefit]:
- If coaching: Players need reliable stats
- If content: Story angle of "undeniable proof"
- If media: Pathway data for prospects
- If trainer: Client proof of improvement

Not asking for anything yet. Just thought you'd dig it.

Curious what you think?

### Coach Pain-Point DM
```
Hey [name],

Saw your post about [pain point: admin, stats, time, player tracking].

I built CourtLab exactly for that. Takes coaches from 2 hrs/week admin 
to 15 minutes. Players see verified progress instead of guessing.

Free tier covers [basic feature]. Pro is $99/year if you like it.

Worth a try? No credit card needed.
