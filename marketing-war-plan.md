# CourtLab Marketing War Plan
## Synthesized from Gary Vaynerchuk, Alex Hormozi, Myron Golden + Current Capabilities

**Mission:** Make CourtLab unavoidable in Australian basketball. Every coach, parent, and serious junior player knows us.

---

## 🥊 THE GARY V PRINCIPLES (Content & Distribution)

### Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook
**The Formula:** Give value 3x before asking once.

**For CourtLab:**
- **Jab 1:** Free training tip with no pitch
- **Jab 2:** Behind-the-scenes content (why we built this)
- **Jab 3:** Coach testimonial or player success story
- **Right Hook:** "Link in bio for early access" or "Join 500+ coaches tracking their players"

**Current Status:** ⚠️ NOT OPTIMIZED — We're doing 1:1 jab-to-hook ratio in current calendar

**Fix:** Restructure content to 3:1 ratio minimum

### Native Content Per Platform
**Gary V Rule:** Don't cross-post the same content. Each platform has different "context."

| Platform | Context | CourtLab Strategy |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| **Instagram** | Visual inspiration, aspiration | Before/after player metrics, high-quality training shots |
| **TikTok** | Entertainment, education fast | 15-sec "Did you know?" + "Track it with CourtLab" |
| **Twitter/X** | Conversation, thought leadership | Hot takes on youth sports data, coach threads |
| **Facebook** | Community, events, parents | Easter Classic event, parent education, longer-form |
| **LinkedIn** | Professional, B2B | Club partnership case studies, "I built this" founder story |
| **YouTube** | Deep education | Full combine walkthroughs, coach tutorials |

**Current Status:** ❌ FAILING — Same captions cross-posted to IG + FB

### The "Thumbnail + Hook" Rule
**Gary V:** "The biggest missed opportunity is thumbnails and the first 3 seconds."

**CourtLab Action:**
- Every Reel needs a scroll-stopping first frame (text overlay: "Your vertical jump is a lie")
- First 2 seconds = pattern interrupt (not logo, not "Hey guys")
- Example hooks:
  - "That coach is wrong about your kid. Here's the data..."
  - "I tested 200 kids. 80% couldn't touch their combine numbers from last year."
  - "The $7.99 app lied to this player. Here's what actually happened."

---

## 💰 THE HORMOZI PRINCIPLES (Offers & Conversion)

### The Grand Slam Offer Formula
**Hormozi:** Stack value so high the price feels like a mistake.

**Current CourtLab Offer:** "Track stats for free, upgrade to Pro"

**The Problem:** Weak. No urgency. No risk reversal.

**The Fix — Grand Slam Offer:**

**COURTLAB PRO — $29/month (or $199/year)**
- ✅ Verified combine tracking (unlimited players)
- ✅ Video playbook creation (up to 50 videos)
- ✅ Hyper-local leaderboards
- ✅ Parent progress reports (auto-generated)
- ✅ **BONUS:** Easter Classic 2026 combine entry ($50 value)
- ✅ **BONUS:** Affiliate program access (earn 20% back)
- ✅ **BONUS:** Private coach community access
- 🎁 **RISK REVERSAL:** 90-day money-back guarantee
- 🎁 **SCARCITY:** First 100 coaches get lifetime 50% off

**Value Stack:** ~$500+ value for $29/month

### The Value Equation
**Hormozi:** Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood of Achievement / (Time Delay × Effort & Sacrifice)

**CourtLab's Equation:**
- **Dream Outcome:** Your kid makes district/state team
- **Perceived Likelihood:** "If I have data, I can prove improvement" = HIGH
- **Time Delay:** Immediate (first combine in 5 minutes)
- **Effort:** Low (app does the work)

**Score:** EXCELLENT — We need to message this clearer

### The "Vehicle of Delivery" Strategy
**Hormozi:** Sell the vehicle (transformation), not the product (features).

**Current Messaging:** "Track stats, create videos, build leaderboards"

**Fixed Messaging:**
- "Give your kid the verified edge that gets them noticed by selectors"
- "Stop hoping your players improve — prove it with data"
- "Become the coach who can show parents exactly where their kid stands"

## 🤝 THE MYRON GOLDEN PRINCIPLES (Affiliate Marketing)

### High-Ticket Affiliate Mindset
**Myron:** Don't sell cheap stuff. Sell transformations.

**Affiliate Program Fix:**

**Current:** "20% commission on subscriptions"

**Upgraded:**
- **Tier 1 (Micro):** 20% on direct referrals
- **Tier 2 (Rising):** 25% + free Pro account at 10 referrals
- **Tier 3 (Elite):** 30% + revenue share on their players' upgrades

**Bonus Structure:**
- 5 referrals = CourtLab branded gear
- 10 referrals = Featured on our social channels
- 25 referrals = Co-hosted combine event (we bring the tech, they bring the players)

### The "Offer to Affiliate" Pitch
**Myron:** Make affiliates feel like partners, not salespeople.

**Outreach Template:**

```
Subject: Partnership proposal — not an affiliate pitch

{{name}},

I've been watching your content. Your focus on {{specific thing}} is exactly 
what youth basketball needs.

I'm not asking you to "promote CourtLab." I'm asking if you want to offer 
your players something that validates what you're already teaching them.

Here's the deal:
- Every player you refer gets 20% off (they save, you earn)
- You get a branded dashboard showing your players' progress
- We co-create content: "How {{name}} uses data to develop players"
- At 25 referrals, we sponsor a combine event together

If this doesn't fit your philosophy, no worries. But if you're tired of 
parents asking "Is my kid improving?" — I have the answer.

Reply YES and I'll send the partnership agreement.

## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS

### What Gary V Would Say:
> "You're posting too much 'right hook' and not enough 'jab.' Give value until they feel guilty not buying."

**Our Fix:** 3 value posts for every 1 sales post. Native content per platform.

### What Hormozi Would Say:
> "Your offer is weak. Stack value until $29 feels like theft. Add risk reversal. Create scarcity."

**Our Fix:** Grand Slam Offer with bonuses + 90-day guarantee + first 100 lifetime discount.

### What Myron Would Say:
> "Stop begging affiliates. Position CourtLab as the tool that makes THEM look better to their players."

**Our Fix:** Partnership language, not affiliate language. Co-create content. Revenue share on THEIR success.

## 🎬 THE BOTTOM LINE

**Current State:** We have the product, the content library, and the platform access. We're missing:
1. Consistent value-first content (fixable this week)
2. Lead capture infrastructure (fixable this week)
3. Paid acquisition (fixable next week)
4. Affiliate activation (fixable this week)

**Investment Required:**
- **Month 1:** $150-300 (tools) + $300 (ads) = **$450-600**
- **Month 2:** $500-800 (scale) = **$500-800**
- **Month 3:** $1000+ (domination) = **$1000+**

**Total 90-Day Investment:** ~$2,000-2,500

**Expected ROI:**
- 75 paid customers × $29/month = $2,175 MRR
- 20 active affiliates × 10 referrals each × 20% conversion = 40 additional customers
- **Total:** ~$3,300 MRR within 90 days

**Verdict:** The math works. The strategy is sound. The only question is execution speed.
