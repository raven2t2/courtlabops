      "title": "Combine Data Storytelling — 'Before/After Player Cards'",
      "category": "Competitive Positioning + Content Proof",
      "why_now": "Hudl owns game film. We own player development over time. Combines give us the baseline. Time to visualize the arc.",
      "specific_targets": [
        "Club directors evaluating tools (LinkedIn, email outreach via affiliates)",
        "Coaches on basketball coaching forums + APB coaching telegram groups",
        "Parents tired of being told 'your kid improved' (no proof)"

      "execution": {
        "asset_1": "Design 3 player cards (mock data from real CourtLab early testers): 'Isaac — Week 1 Baseline → 6 Weeks Later'. Show: combine baseline (shot % / height / lateral speed) → real improvement arc. Visual before/after comparison.",
        "asset_2": "Draft accompanying LinkedIn post (Michael): 'Coaches say 'your kid got better.' Parents ask 'how much?' We answer with data. Baseline. Weekly. No guessing. This is Isaac's 6-week arc at [Club].' (image carousel)",
        "asset_3": "Email template for outreach: Send to 10 interested coaches who haven't signed yet. Subject: 'See how one of our coaches proved player development (with data)'. Attach sample card + link to Lite playground."
      },
      "why_works": "Shows CourtLab does what Hudl can't: transformation proof. Parents pay fees for development; we show it. Coaches selling spots to parents suddenly have a killer asset.",
      "why_competitors_miss": "Hudl is about game film (what happened). We're about player development (what changed). Different conversation entirely.",
      "blockers_and_fixes": [
        "Issue: Don't have clean player data yet",
        "Fix: Use mock/redacted data from CourtLab pilot. Anonymise. Show trend shape, not names."

      "category": "Founder Brand + Education",
      "why_now": "We just proved (Feb 9) that keyword research is 80% wrong. That's a founder-level learning moment. Turn it into a Series B narrative.",
      "specific_targets": [
        "Series B investors (blog post + LinkedIn + email)",
        "Tech founder communities (ProductHunt, IndieHackers, Twitter tech)",

Structure: (1) Gut theory (wrong), (2) Data reality (winners), (3) Lesson for coaches (distrust your instincts, trust live data). Frame as founder learning, not sales pitch.",
        "angle": "Investors want to see: founder humility + data discipline + speed of iteration. This delivers all 3. Subtext: 'CourtLab founders think like coaches — we test assumptions, validate with real data, iterate fast.'",

        "campaign_3": "Ad + social angle (secondary): Instagram carousel showing Combine energy + athlete excitement. Hook: 'Free combine baseline + data = coaches love it, parents understand their kid's progress.' Target: Parents following SA basketball clubs."
      },
      "why_works": "Combines are the 'demo' that makes CourtLab inevitable. Once a coach runs one and parents see the PDF, platform adoption becomes obvious. This is top-of-funnel but with proof.",
      "expected_outcome": "Run 5 events in Feb (5 clubs × $0 platform) → 5 clubs see baseline reporting + parent value → 4-5 of them become inbound leads for Year 1 contract (convert by end of March).",
      "blockers_and_fixes": [
        "Issue: Combine delivery logistics (venue, personnel)",
