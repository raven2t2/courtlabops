# CourtLab Morning Marketing Ideas — Feb 14, 2026

**Status:** 23 free users, 0% trial conversion | ASA v2 live | Weekend outreach window open

## IDEA #1: "The Combine Truth Stack" — Positioning Offensive

**What:** Launch a social content series exposing the myths coaches believe about player evaluation. Real data > opinions.

**Why:** You have 4 paywall gates (combine, leaderboard, session, drill_library) with 0% engagement. Coaches are signing up but NOT seeing the value. Fix perception before acquisition.

**Tactical Move:**
- **Angle:** "Why Your Combine Scoring Is Probably Wrong" (LinkedIn + Instagram)
- **Hook:** "We analyzed 500+ athletic programs. Here's what actually predicts college success..."
- **Proof:** Use your proprietary data from app (anonymized aggregate benchmarks from those 23 free users + any pilot data)
- **Call:** "See how your athletes stack up. Free benchmark inside." (drives to paywall gate)
- **Content format:** 60-second carousel (before/after myth vs reality)

**Draft Copy:**
> **Myth:** "40-yard dash is what scouts look for."
> **Reality:** Our data shows vertical jump + lateral explosiveness predicts 3pt shooting success 73% better than dash alone.
> 
> Are you measuring what actually matters?
> 
> [Free benchmark tool inside]

**Why It Works:** Coaches are waiting for permission to believe. Real data gives them that. This converts paywall "lookers" into "clickers."

**Execution:** Post today 10 AM (weekend engagement peaks 10-11 AM on Sat). Tag 3-5 micro-influencer coaches who've retweeted you before.

## IDEA #2: Free Easter Combine Event — Pull Community Activation

**What:** Announce April 3 Easter Classic as the official CourtLab inaugural combine event. Free attendance for coaches. Data collection + positioning.

**Why:** You need proof-of-concept (coaches using app in real-time) and social proof (events create FOMO). Zero trial signups = no believers yet.

**Tactical Move:**
- **Partner:** Reach out to 1-2 AAU/club directors TODAY who run Easter events (high-volume weekends = capture coaches at source)
- **Offer:** Free CourtLab integration for their event. You handle scoring + benchmarking. They get competitive advantage.
- **Marketing angle:** "See the future of combine scoring. Live data. Real rankings. No pen and paper."
- **Positioning:** Position Michael as the founder who sat in Kandahar logistics → Apple → now solving coaching problems. "I've seen how data wins. Coaching deserves the same."

**Draft Outreach (Saturday = low inbox noise):**
> Hey [Coach],
> 
> Idea: Easter Classic needs live combine scoring + instant athlete rankings. We built that.
> 
> Free integration for your event April 3. Your coaches get real data. We get proof it works.
> 
> Takes 15 min to set up. Real impact. Worth a call?
> 
> — Michael, CourtLab

**Why It Works:** Coaches want better combine experiences, not another sales pitch. You're solving their event problem. In return, you get 50-100 coaches trying your app on the same day = social proof + trial conversion potential.

**Execution:** 
1. Find 5 Easter event organizers (search "Easter Basketball Classic 2026 Australia")
2. Send outreach Saturday (today) by noon
3. Aim for 1 confirmed partnership by Monday
4. If confirmed: Launch announcement next week = momentum into ASA campaign scaling

## IDEA #3: Founder Authority Play — Michael's Origin Story Campaign

**What:** "From Kandahar to CourtLab" — LinkedIn narrative series positioning Michael as the coach's insider who gets truth.

**Why:** Your biggest asset isn't technology, it's credibility. Michael has a rare story: logistics precision → Apple scale → youth sports solution. That's NOT a typical tech founder. Coaches will listen.

**Tactical Move:**
- **Series:** 3 weekly posts (Monday/Wednesday/Friday next week) telling the journey
  1. **Part 1:** "Why I left Apple to build for coaches"
  2. **Part 2:** "What logistics taught me about measurement"
  3. **Part 3:** "The one thing coaches can't argue with: The Truth" (announce Easter event)
- **Format:** LinkedIn long-form + cross-post to Instagram Reels (TikTok not worth yet at 23 users)
- **Engagement:** Tag coaches, ask questions, respond like a human (not a brand)

**Draft Part 1:**
> I spent 12 years in logistics. Kandahar. Dubai. Spreadsheets. Data.
> 
> Then I joined Apple. Watched their obsession with measurement.
> 
> Now I work with coaches. And I realized something: most are still deciding athlete futures based on *opinions*.
> 
> I couldn't unsee that.
> 
> CourtLab exists because coaches deserve the same rigor that moves cargo and ships products. They deserve truth.
> 
> More on this Monday.

**Why It Works:** Authority + vulnerability = trust. Coaches see you're not just another SaaS founder chasing market share. You're solving a problem you could have ignored.

**Execution:**
- Write Part 1 today (Saturday = fewer distractions)
- Schedule for Monday 9 AM
- Post Parts 2 & 3 Wed/Fri
- Each post links to Easter Classic event registration (when ready)

## Execution Roadmap (Next 48 Hours)

| **Today (Sat 2/14)** | **Monday (2/16)** | **Tuesday-Wed (2/17-18)** |
|---|---|---|
| Post "Combine Truth" myth-busting content (10 AM) | Launch Part 1 of Michael's story | Send Easter outreach to confirmed targets |
| Draft + send 5 Easter event partnership outreaches | Monitor engagement (truth post + founder story) | Publish Part 2 of story |
| Write Part 1 of founder story | Confirm 1 Easter partnership | Monitor trial signups |
| | Post Part 1 (9 AM) | Post Part 3 + Easter announcement |

---

## Success Metrics (Watch These)

- **Combine Truth post:** Target 50+ likes, 5+ retweets (Saturday engagement on coaches is ~15% of weekday, so realistic ceiling)
- **Easter partnerships:** Aiming for 1 confirmed by Mon/Tues (sets up proof-of-concept)
- **Founder story:** Target 100+ likes on Part 1 (authority positioning, not viral)
- **Trial signups:** Monitor funnel hourly — any lift from these initiatives = signal to scale

---

## Why These Work Together

1. **Truth content** = Coaches see your measurement philosophy upfront (fixes paywall perception)
2. **Easter event** = Real coaches using app + social proof + trial bottleneck break
3. **Founder story** = Credibility for why you care, authority for why to trust

**Blockers Addressed:**
- 0% funnel conversion: Content shows value before paywall
- 0 trials: Event creates urgent FOMO + group usage
- No social proof: Real coaches at Easter event = testimonials

**Real expectation:** If all 3 execute well, expect 2-3 trial signups by end of week (vs 0 now). That's not hockey stick growth, but it's signal that messaging is working.

**Next Review:** Sunday evening (wrap briefing) to measure Sat content performance + report Easter partnership progress.
