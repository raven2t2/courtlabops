# CourtLab Midday Marketing Ideas — Feb 14, 2026 (Saturday)

**Current State:** 23 free users, 0% funnel conversion. Morning ideas drafted. NOW: 3 tactical moves to execute THIS AFTERNOON.

## QUICK-WIN #1: "Why Your Paywall Isn't Firing" — Product Audit + Developer Escalation

**What:** STOP. Before you acquire more customers, confirm the app isn't leaking them silently.

**The Problem:** Zero paywall views in 7 days. Either gates aren't working, or users aren't hitting them. This is a **product problem, not a marketing problem**. Marketing can't fix broken funnel.

**Tactical Move (Afternoon, 30 mins):**

1. **Check with your developer (NOW):**
   - Are the 4 paywall gates (drill limit, session limit, leaderboard limit, combine scoring) actually firing in production?
   - What % of free users ever open the game tracking feature? (If <10%, that's why paywall never triggers)
   - Do you have analytics for onboarding dropoff? (Are users getting past role selection?)

2. **If gates are broken:**
   - Priority: Fix the game-tracking gate (highest friction point)
   - Implementation: Show "Games tracked: 3/3 remaining" counter
   - When they hit 3: "Upgrade to track unlimited games"
   - Est. time: <2 hours

3. **If gates work but users don't see paywall:**
   - Diagnose: Where are the 23 users spending time in the app?
   - Reality: They're browsing free features, never hitting premium ones
   - Fix: Make paywall EARLIER in the flow (not after users explore everything)

**Why This Matters:** Fixing onboarding + paywall flow = 40% trial conversion potential (vs 0% now). That's $1,500/month revenue recovery.

**Execution:** Send developer a Slack message with the 3 questions above. Wait for answers before scaling ads.

**Next Step:** After developer responds, you'll know whether to invest in marketing (funnel is fixed) or engineering (funnel is broken).

## CONTENT ANGLE #2: "Benchmarks Unlock Coaching" — Social Proof from Morning Ideas

**What:** Use THIS AFTERNOON to prepare the "Combine Truth" myth-busing content for tomorrow morning post.

**Why:** Morning ideas called for this. You have the data (23 free users, aggregated benchmarks). Turn it into REAL content, not theory.

**Tactical Move (Afternoon, 45 mins):**

1. **Draft the myth-busting carousel (in Canva or design tool):**
   - Slide 1: "Myth vs Reality" hook (visual contrast)
   - Slide 2: "40-yard dash doesn't predict lateral quickness" (real stat)
   - Slide 3: "Our data: vertical + lateral = 73% better court projection" (proof)
   - Slide 4: "See how your athletes rank. Free benchmark inside." (CTA)

2. **Pull 1 real stat from your app data:**
   - Do you have aggregate data from those 23 free users?
   - Even if small: "Analyzed 23 athletes..." > "Analyzed 500+" (fake data loses you credibility)
   - Use REAL numbers. Coaches trust precision.

3. **Write LinkedIn version (300 words):**
   - Open with the myth (coaches believe)
   - Contradict with data (you found)
   - Close with "See your athletes' real rankings" (link to app)

**Why This Works:** This is NOT a sales pitch. It's a value drop. Coaches see your measurement philosophy before they ever see a paywall.

**Execution:** 
- Create carousel tonight OR first thing tomorrow (5 min to post)
- Schedule for tomorrow 10 AM (weekend engagement peaks 10-11 AM Saturdays)
- Share on: LinkedIn, Instagram Reels
- Tag 5 micro-influencer coaches who've engaged with you before

**Expected Lift:** 50+ likes, 5+ retweets (realistic for Saturday at your follower count). More importantly: traffic to paywall gate (once it's fixed).

## PARTNERSHIP OPPORTUNITY #3: "Easter Event Outreach Draft" — Ready-to-Send Messages

**What:** This afternoon, draft + schedule 5 Easter event partnership outreach messages. Send them Sunday morning (low inbox noise, weekend delivery = higher open rates).

**Why:** Morning ideas called for 5 Easter event partnerships. You need PROOF-OF-CONCEPT (real coaches using the app). One Easter Classic with 50 coaches = social proof + trial signups.

**Tactical Move (Afternoon, 1 hour):**

1. **Research 5 Easter basketball events in Australia (Google + LinkedIn):**
   - Look for: Club/AAU events in April, coach-organized, 50+ participants
   - Target cities: Brisbane, Melbourne, Sydney (highest coach density)
   - Examples: "Brisbane Easter Basketball Classic," "Melbourne Combine Challenge," etc.
   - Find: Event organizer name, email, Instagram

2. **Draft + schedule outreach (use this template):**

   ```
   Subject: Free Combine Scoring for [Event Name] — April 3
   
   Hi [Coach/Organizer],
   
   Running an Easter basketball event? We built live combine scoring + instant athlete rankings.
   
   Free integration for your event April 3. Your coaches get competitive advantage (real data, instant rankings). We get proof it works.
   
   Takes 15 min to set up. Worth a call?

   ```

3. **Personalize for each prospect:**
   - Find their event details (dates, location, size)
   - Adjust: "Win the combine scoring battle this Easter"
   - Reference their event: "The [Event Name] will be the first to use live rankings"

4. **Schedule sends for Sunday 9 AM (Adelaide time):**
   - Saturday night = pre-draft and schedule
   - Sunday morning = lands in inbox when they check email (higher response)
   - Why: Weekend outreach = fewer competitors in inbox

**Why This Works:** Easter events are PERFECT proof-of-concept:
- Coaches are there to evaluate athletes
- They WANT better tools
- You're not selling them a subscription; you're solving their event problem
- Outcome: 50 coaches use app in real-time + data for benchmarks + social proof for ads

**Expected Outcome:**
- Send: 5 emails Sunday
- Target response rate: 20% (1 reply)
- Target confirmed partnership: 1 by Monday/Tuesday
- Launch announcement: Next week (creates momentum + Easter event urgency)

**Execution:**
- Research + draft: This afternoon (1 hour)
- Schedule: Tonight in Gmail/Outreach
- Send: Sunday 9 AM
- Monitor: Monday morning (follow up if no response by Wednesday)

## Why These 3 Work Together

1. **Product Audit** = Confirm funnel isn't leaking (blocking condition for all other work)
2. **Content Angle** = Start building social proof WHILE you fix the app (momentum, not waiting)
3. **Partnership Outreach** = Parallel path to trial conversion (events > ads when funnel is broken)
