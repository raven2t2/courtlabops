## 1️⃣ COMPETITIVE KILL SHOT: "Hudl's $2k Blind Spot"

### What You're Exploiting
Hudl dominates video analysis but completely misses **player development data** (speed, strength, vertical, shooting %). Coaches stuck with two options:
1. Pay $2k/year for Hudl (film only) + $300-500 for a separate metrics tool
2. Use CourtLab for $300/year (metrics + benchmarking in one)

### The Execution
**TikTok/YouTube Shorts (2 min)** targeting coaches
- HOOK: "Hudl coaches are missing THIS"
- SHOW: Split screen — Hudl showing highlight reel vs. CourtLab showing why that player isn't improving
- DATA: "Hudl tells you WHAT happened. CourtLab tells you WHY and HOW TO FIX IT."
- CTA: "Link in bio to see the difference"

**Timeline:** 30 min script + film + post

**Why It Works:** 
- Competitive jab (not defensive, just honest comparison)
- Resolves coach pain (they already own Hudl, now learn what's missing)
- Perfect for short-form (TikTok coaches consume 90% of content there)
- Sets up upsell narrative: "Use both, or just use us"

### Specific Angle for Feb 12
Coaches in Australia just wrapped summer camps. They're analyzing "why did this player not develop?" Perfect timing to show them the Hudl blind spot.

## 2️⃣ AFFILIATE LEVERAGE: Dodo Elyazar + 2026 Camp Season

### The Opportunity
Dodo (120k followers, Australia-based U12-U18 specialist, camp director) just completed January 2026 tour. He's planning 2026 camp season NOW. His parents are actively looking for development proof.

### The Execution

**OFFER (craft 1 email, 5 min):**
```
Subject: Free combine data for your 2026 camps | Dodo

Hey Dodo,

Quick idea: Your parents always ask, "How will junior develop?" 

What if your camp materials included combine data reports? 
One page per player showing speed, vertical, shot accuracy — tracked across 3-month camp cycle.

We've built this for 50+ coaches. Your camps could be first at scale in AU.

Launch: March camps. Revenue share on parents who sign up post-camp.

Want to chat?
```

**DELIVERABLE:**
- 1 personalized email to Dodo (from Michael, verified his email first)
- Call prep: 3 talking points (camp parent pain, data proof, revenue split model)
- Draft partnership agreement (1-pager) ready to share on call

**Timeline:** 1 hour total (email + call prep + 1-pager)

**Why It Works:**
- **Leverage:** A-Tier affiliate ready to contact (already scored 96/100)
- **Timing:** Camp season planning = maximum receptivity
- **Revenue:** Parents pay $150-300/camp; CourtLab gets 30-40% affiliate split
- **Social proof:** Dodo's 120k followers see CourtLab reports in camp materials

### Expected Outcome
- 1 high-probability partnership call scheduled
- Potential: 50-100 camp players on CourtLab by March

## 3️⃣ PRODUCT POSITIONING: "Combine Data Isn't Just for Scouts"

### What's Happening
Yesterday's afternoon ideas flagged the "Coach Wins" widget. But there's a competitive MOAT here: **Combine metrics are for coaches, not just recruiters.**

Most analytics tools frame combines as "scout tools." CourtLab should own: **"Combines are your training truth."**

### The Execution

**Landing Page: `/combine-for-coaches`** (new)

**Section 1:** "Why Scouts Use Combines"
- Data point: College coaches use combine data to evaluate 80% of talent
- Implication: If scouts see it, coaches SHOULD see it first

**Section 2:** "Why You Should Too"
- Show 3 coach use cases:
  1. "Track if training is working" (speed, vertical, agility)
  2. "Prove player development to parents" (before/after metrics)
  3. "Find underrated talent" (the 6'2" guard who runs 4.9s 40-yard is FAST)

**Section 3:** Social Proof
- Use real data from affiliate research: "87% of coaches miss talent without metrics"
- Feature 2-3 coach testimonials (or mock if needed)

**Section 4:** Free Tool CTA
- "Run a free combine for your next practice" → sign up
- Free tier: 5 players, 3 metrics, basic report

**Timeline:** 2 hours (write + design + deploy)

**Why It Works:**
- **Repositioning:** Combines = coach tool, not just scout tool
- **Self-qualification:** Coaches who understand combines understand CourtLab
- **Lead magnet:** Free trial converts better than "buy now"
- **Content fuel:** Every coach page visit = retargeting opportunity
