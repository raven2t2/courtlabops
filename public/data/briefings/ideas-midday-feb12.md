# CourtLab Midday Ideas — Thursday, Feb 12, 2026

**Time:** 11:30 AM Adelaide | **Phase:** Week 1 ASA Campaign (Active)

---

## 1. QUICK-WIN: App Store Listing Refresh (Execute TODAY — 10 min)

**Status:** Identified gap from ASA strategy v2  
**Action:** Update App Store Connect subtitle to align with proven keywords

**Current:** "Youth Skills, Drills & Stats"  
**New:** "Basketball Stats & Training"  
→ Direct match to proven keywords ("basketball training" 25% TTR, "basketball drills" 50% TTR)

**Next Steps:**
1. Log in to App Store Connect (2 min)
2. Edit app > Localizable Display Information > Subtitle
3. Change to: "Basketball Stats & Training"
4. Submit for review (typically 2-4 hours)
5. Confirm live before next ASA weekly review

**Why This Matters:**
- Keywords are live ($25/day budget running). Subtitle mismatch = lost conversion potential.
- Proven keyword data shows parents/coaches search "basketball training" and "basketball drills"
- Better subtitle alignment = higher tap-to-install rate on ads already running

**Owner:** Michael (10 min) | **Deadline:** Today, before 5 PM Adelaide

## 2. CONTENT ANGLE: Coaching Velocity Case Study (Social + Email)

**Hook:** "Why coaches adopt CourtLab in 72 hours (not 90 days)"

**Angle:** Pull from Combine data + real coach feedback. Coaches love results, not features.

**Draft Social Post (LinkedIn/Twitter):**
```
"One thing we learned from 50+ combine events:
Coaches don't care about development philosophy.
They care about one thing: Can I see it working?

A combine baseline tells them.
72 hours later:
- Player sees their first benchmark
- Coach sees team trends
- Parents get proof their kid is improving

That's why coaches stay. Not promises. Proof.

Become Undeniable. 🏀"
```

**Email Subject (Draft for coaches list):**
"72-Hour Proof: Why Coaches Adopt CourtLab (Real Data)"

**Next Steps:**
1. Pull 3-5 real quotes from recent combine events (CourtLab Combines folder)
2. Structure 3-part case study: Setup → Baseline → Insight
3. Post to LinkedIn Wednesday AM (timing: coaches check socials 8-9 AM before games)
4. Email coaches list Thursday afternoon (post-practice timing)

**Why This Works:**
- Coaches respond to evidence, not features. "Proof" resonates.
- Combines are your acquisition wedge — case studies turn event attendance into trial sign-ups.
- Social + email combo reaches coaches where they're already thinking about development.

**Owner:** This agent (draft + schedule) | **Execute:** Friday AM (posting)

## 3. PARTNERSHIP QUICK-HIT: NSW/Victoria Club Outreach (Lead Generation)

**Opportunity:** ASA campaign running in AU. Expand mindshare while paid spend is active.

**Target:** 5-10 established club coaches (next tier from current SA focus) in NSW + VIC  
**Angle:** Free Combine Day pilot + baseline data

**Outreach Template (Email):**
```
Subject: Free Combine Day — Baseline Your Team (No Commitment)

Hi [Coach],

We're running baseline combines across AU this month. Free for your club — no platform commitment.

One session, 90 minutes:
- Zone shooting % (simple)
- Height/reach (fun)
- One optional movement drill

Within 72 hours: Team trends report + player PDFs with 2-3 focus areas.

Takes the guesswork out of "what do we work on this season?"

Available: [Dates across Feb/March]
Spots: Limited to 5-10 teams in your region

Interested? One-liner back and we'll lock in your slot.

Cheers,
Michael Ragland
CourtLab"
```

**Target Clubs (Example — Build Real List):**
- Eastside Allstars (Sydney) — established mid-tier club, ~300 juniors
- Nunawading Spectres (Melbourne) — known for development focus
- Penrith Panthers (Sydney) — growing club, looking for edge
- Ringwood Hawks (Melbourne) — strong community base
- Campbelltown Cavs (Sydney) — partner club network

**Why This Works:**
- Combines are pull marketing (solves their problem: "what do we work on?")
- Free eliminates friction. One baseline day ≠ commitment, but it creates urgency for trial.
- Expands footprint during paid campaign (ASA running = mindshare moment)
- Early-stage partnerships = future testimonials for paid media
