## 💪 THE ZERO-BUDGET CONTENT ENGINE

### The Gary V "Document, Don't Create" Strategy
**Instead of:** Spending hours on polished content
**Do this:** Document your actual work building CourtLab

**Daily Content Pillars (Free to Produce):**

1. **"Building in Public"** (Twitter/LinkedIn)
   - Screenshot of code/features being built
   - "Just shipped X. Here's why it matters for coaches..."
   - Share failures: "Tried this feature. Didn't work. Here's what I learned."

2. **"Coach Spotlight"** (Instagram/Stories)
   - Feature a coach (with permission)
   - "Coach Mike's drill for improving vertical"
   - Tag them — they share to their audience

3. **"Before/After"** (All platforms)
   - Player metrics at Day 1 vs. Day 30
   - "No improvement" posts are just as valuable — honesty builds trust

4. **"Hot Takes"** (Twitter threads)
   - "The combine industry is broken. Here's why..."
   - "Parents: Stop focusing on highlight reels. Here's what matters..."

5. **"Behind the Scenes"** (Stories/Reels)
   - Setting up for a combine
   - Testing the app
   - Real user feedback

### The Manual Posting Schedule (Free)

| Day | Morning (7-8am) | Midday (12-1pm) | Evening (6-8pm) |
|-----|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Monday** | Twitter thread (value) | IG Story (BTS) | LinkedIn (founder post) |
| **Tuesday** | Twitter (engagement) | IG Post (photo + caption) | Facebook (parent group) |
| **Wednesday** | Twitter (hot take) | IG Story (poll/question) | TikTok (15-sec tip) |
| **Thursday** | Twitter (value) | IG Post (photo + caption) | LinkedIn (case study) |
| **Friday** | Twitter (weekly recap) | IG Story (weekend prep) | Facebook (weekend events) |
| **Saturday** | Twitter (light) | IG Post (motivation) | TikTok (drill demo) |
| **Sunday** | Twitter (planning) | IG Story (behind scenes) | Content planning for week |

**Monthly Budget:** 10 IG posts + 10 FB posts (Upload-Post free tier)
**Unlimited:** Twitter, LinkedIn, TikTok, Stories

## 🤝 ZERO-BUDGET AFFILIATE ACTIVATION

### The "50 Free Affiliates" Strategy
Instead of: Paid affiliate software
Do this: Manual tracking + relationship building

**Step 1: The Personal DM Approach**
Don't send cold emails. Send warm DMs.

**Template:**
```
Hey {{name}}, I've been following your content for a while. 
Your approach to {{specific thing}} is exactly what basketball needs.

I built CourtLab because I got tired of apps that didn't work for 
local clubs. No AI guesswork — just verified combine data.

I'd love to get your take on it. Not asking for a post or anything — 
just your honest feedback as someone who actually coaches.

If it's useful for your players, happy to set you up with a free 
Pro account + a way to earn if you want to share it.

Either way, keep doing what you're doing.

Michael
```

**Step 2: The Manual Tracking System**
Create a Google Sheet:
- Affiliate name
- Unique code (e.g., NAY15, DODO15)
- Referrals (manual count from signups)
- Commission owed (20% × price × referrals)
- Paid? (Y/N)
- Notes

**Step 3: The 5/5/5 Outreach Blitz**
Every weekday:
- 5 Instagram DMs to coaches
- 5 LinkedIn connections to club admins
- 5 Comments on basketball posts (value-first)

**That's 75 touchpoints per week = 300/month = 900/quarter**

### Priority Targets (Free to Contact)

| Name | Handle | Why Now | Approach |
|------|--------|---------|----------|
| **Dodo Elyazar** | @the.baller.movement | AU tour just finished, planning 2026 | "Loved your tour. Partnership for next year?" |
| **Ian Morris** | @morrisperformancebasketball | Micro-influencer, high trust | "Sydney trainer to Sydney trainer" |
| **Joey Wright** | @thewrightcoach12 | Adelaide local, 5K followers | Local meetup offer |
| **Nay Sakya** | @breakdown_basketball | Elite credibility | "For your academy students" |
| **Riley Parkinson** | @parkoballtraining | Melbourne gym owner | "QR codes at your gym" |

   - Day 1 metrics vs. Day 30 metrics
   - "What 30 days of tracking looks like"

4. **"Stitch/Reply" (15 sec)**
   - Find popular basketball video
   - Stitch with: "Here's why this drill works + how to track it"

5. **"POV" (15 sec)**
   - "POV: You just got selected because you had verified combine data"
