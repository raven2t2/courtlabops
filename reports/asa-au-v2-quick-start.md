# ASA AU V2 - Quick Start Guide

**Constraint:** $25/day budget, top 5 keywords, prove <$10 CPA

---

## STEP 1: UPDATE APP STORE SUBTITLE (TODAY)

❌ **Current:** "Youth Skills, Drills & Stats"
✅ **New:** "Verified Combine Times & Stats"

Why: Current subtitle is generic. Apple Search Ads quality score improves with keyword-relevant metadata.

**How:**
1. Go to App Store Connect
2. Edit "CourtLab Basketball Trainer" listing
3. Change Subtitle field
4. Submit (usually instant approval)
5. Wait 2-4 hours for live

Expected impact: CTR improvement 3-5x (from 0.91% toward 3-5%)

---

## STEP 2: LAUNCH 5-KEYWORD CAMPAIGN ($25/day)

Once subtitle is live, create Apple Search Ads campaign:

| # | Keyword | Bid | Daily Budget | Notes |
|---|---------|-----|--------------|-------|
| 1 | basketball combine timer | $1.00 | $8 | Coaches measuring athletes |
| 2 | basketball stats app | $0.60 | $6 | High volume + intent |
| 3 | combine times tracker | $1.00 | $5 | Very qualified searchers |
| 4 | basketball coach app | $0.70 | $4 | Team management angle |
| 5 | basketball combine australia | $0.85 | $2 | AU-specific, seasonal |

**Total:** $25/day

---

## STEP 3: DAILY MONITORING (7 Days)

Track these metrics daily:

```
DATE: [DATE]
Impressions:  [X]
Taps:         [Y]
Installs:     [Z]
Spend:        $[S]
CTR:          [Y/X]%
CPA:          $[S/Z]

BY KEYWORD:
[Repeat for each keyword above]
```

**Target Metrics:**
- CTR: 3-5% (combine keywords), 2-4% (other keywords)
- CPA: <$10 aggregate
- Daily spend: $20-30

## THE 5-KEYWORD STRATEGY

**Why these 5?**

- **#1 + #3 (Combine keywords):** Exact match to CourtLab's core feature. Coaches actively looking. Highest intent.
- **#2 + #4 (Coaching keywords):** Broader appeal. Coaches managing teams + stats. Moderate intent.
- **#5 (AU-specific):** Geographic relevance. Lower volume but high-intent AU coaches. Seasonal spike.

**Why only 5?**
- Budget constraint: $25/day = focus not breadth
- Quality over quantity: 5 high-intent > 30 mixed-intent
- Testing philosophy: Prove model with winners first, then expand

## RULES FOR WEEKLY ADJUSTMENTS

**If a keyword CTR >5% (combine keywords) or >4% (others):**
- Increase bid +10%
- Allocate freed budget to this keyword
- Status: "Winner" — track for scaling

**If a keyword CTR <2% (combine) or <1% (others):**
- Reduce bid -20%
- OR pause after 3 days if no improvement
- Status: "Loser" — consider replacing

**If aggregate CPA trending >$12 (after 4 days):**
- Pause lowest-CTR keyword
- Reallocate budget to top 2 (combine timer + stats app)
- Focus on proven winners

**If aggregate CPA trending <$8 (after 4 days):**
- Increase daily budget +20% (to $30/day if under)
- Test 1 new keyword
- Prepare scaling plan for Week 2
