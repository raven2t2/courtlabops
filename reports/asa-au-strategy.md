# Apple Search Ads AU Strategy for CourtLab
**Basketball Trainer - Australian Market Expansion**

---

## Executive Summary

**Current Performance (Feb 2-8, 2026):**
- AU Campaign: 331 impressions, 3 taps, 0 installs, $20.65 spent
- CTR: 0.91% (vs Global 7.64%)
- Problem: High visibility, zero conversion = messaging or targeting mismatch

**Root Cause Analysis:**
AU campaign is getting impressions from broad search terms but not converting because:
1. Keywords are generic/too broad (low intent)
2. App Store listing may not be optimized for AU basketball community
3. Ad messaging doesn't match AU coach/parent expectations
4. Competitor app dominance in AU market (HomeCourt, Sideline installed base strong)

**Solution:**
Shift from generic basketball keywords → high-intent AU-specific keywords targeting coaches, club admins, and parents who are actively searching for combine timing, stats, and player development solutions.

## Part 2: Keyword Categorization & Strategy

### A. BRAND TERMS (Defense + Quick Wins)
**Purpose:** Capture people already looking for CourtLab

```
CourtLab
CourtLab basketball
CourtLab trainer
CourtLab app
```

**Strategy:**
- Bid high ($1.50-2.50) — these are super-qualified
- Use defensive bids against competitor brand search
- Low volume, high conversion

---

### B. COMPETITOR TERMS (Offense)
**Purpose:** Convert people choosing between apps

**Primary Competitors:**
1. **HomeCourt** (market leader in AU, $200/year)
   - Keywords: "homecourt alternative", "basketball app like homecourt", "homecourt vs"
   - Bid Strategy: $1.20-2.00 (undercut on price messaging)
   - Ad Message: "Professional combine timing without the subscription cost"

2. **Sideline** (popular for game analysis)
   - Keywords: "sideline basketball app", "sideline alternative"
   - Bid Strategy: $1.10-1.80
   - Ad Message: "Game analysis + player development in one app"

3. **Coach's Eye** (video analysis specialist)
   - Keywords: "coach's eye alternative", "basketball video analysis app"
   - Bid Strategy: $1.00-1.50
   - Ad Message: "Video analysis with verified combine data"

**Strategy:**
- Bid lower than brand terms ($1.20-2.00)
- Emphasize unique value: "Verified timing data" (not AI guesses)
- Test headline: "CourtLab: Combine times coaches trust"

---

### C. GENERIC BASKETBALL TRAINING TERMS
**Purpose:** Own broad searches from coaches/players looking to improve

**Primary Keywords:**
- basketball training app
- basketball stats app
- basketball coaching app
- basketball player development
- basketball drill app
- basketball workout app

**Strategy:**
- **Mid-tier bids** ($1.50-2.80): These are high volume but lower intent
- Target coaches (not casual players)
- Use AI negative keywords: -free, -nba, -highlights, -youtube
- Test ad messaging: "Improve combine times" vs "Track player progress"

---

### D. YOUTH/CLUB/SCHOOL BASKETBALL TERMS
**Purpose:** Reach Australian youth basketball ecosystem (biggest growth market)

**Primary Keywords:**
- youth basketball training app
- basketball club management app
- school basketball team app
- junior basketball coach app
- basketball combine australia
- australian basketball stats

**Strategy:**
- **Moderate bids** ($1.30-2.30): High intent in AU market, good conversion
- Target parents + coaches of youth players
- Messaging: "Prepare kids for next level" + "Combine-ready timing"
- Geographic targeting: Focus on Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney metro areas

---

### E. PLAYER-FOCUSED (Secondary Audience)
**Purpose:** Players looking to improve shooting, stats, performance

**Keywords:**
- basketball shooting tracker
- basketball performance app
- basketball workout app
- basketball skills app

**Strategy:**
- **Lower bids** ($1.20-2.00): Player intent is different from coach intent
- Test messaging: "Track every shot. See progress." vs "Get recruited"
- Consider: CourtLab's primary user is coaches, not players — but players drive family adoption

---

---

## Part 5: App Store Listing Audit & Optimization for AU Market

### CURRENT LISTING STATUS

❌ **Problem Identified:** CourtLab not appearing in App Store search results
- Does not show up for "basketball training app australia"
- Does not show up for "combine timer"
- Possible causes:
  1. App Store listing not live/approved
  2. Keywords not set in App Store Connect metadata
  3. Ratings too low (if live)
  4. App download velocity too slow (new app penalty)

---

### APP STORE METADATA AUDIT CHECKLIST

#### 1. APP NAME/TITLE (30 chars iOS, 50 chars Android)
**Current:** "CourtLab Basketball Trainer" (28 chars) ✅

**Recommendation:** KEEP
- Front-loads "Basketball" (primary keyword)
- Clear value prop "Trainer"
- Memorable name

**Alternative to test:**
- "Basketball Trainer & Combine Timer" (40 chars Android only)
- Pro: More keywords
- Con: Longer, less memorable

---

#### 2. SUBTITLE (iOS Only, 30 chars)
**Current:** Unknown — needs audit

**Recommended Subtitle (if not set):**
"Verified Combine Times & Stats"

**Why:** 
- Emphasizes unique value (verified = not HomeCourt's AI guessing)
- Includes secondary keywords (combine, stats)
- Appeals to coaches (primary user)

**Alternative if Lite version exists:**
"Free Combine Timer + Pro Stats"

---

#### 3. KEYWORD FIELD (iOS App Store Connect)
**Current:** Unknown — CRITICAL TO VERIFY

**Recommended Keywords (100-char limit, comma-separated):**
```
basketball trainer, combine timer, basketball stats, basketball coaching, player development, basketball analytics, verified times, australian basketball
```

**Why these:**
- Mix of high-intent keywords from Tier 1
- AU-specific angle ("australian basketball")
- Covers coach + player perspectives

---

#### 4. DESCRIPTION (First 3 lines are critical)

**Current Status:** Unknown — needs full audit

**Recommended Description (above "Read More"):**

```

---

#### 5. SCREENSHOTS (iOS App Store, Vertical Video Preferred)

---

#### 2. Localized Description
Add AU-specific paragraph:
```

```

#### 3. Local Review Strategy
- Reach out to SA basketball coaches for early reviews
