- ❌ basketball coach app
- ❌ youth basketball training
- ❌ basketball coaching drills
- ❌ kids basketball
- ❌ junior basketball
- ❌ (7 more niche keywords)

**Action:** Delete all of these. They don't exist in real App Store searches.

---

## Part 2: Keywords to TEST (Thinking Like Real Users)

### How to Think of Keywords

**You're a parent looking for a basketball training app:**
- What would you type?
- You wouldn't type "combine timer" (too niche)
- You wouldn't type "youth basketball coach app" (too formal)
- You WOULD type simple stuff

**You're a coach managing a team:**
- What would you search for?
- "basketball stats" (to track player numbers)
- "basketball stats app" (to find an app that does this)
- "basketball score" (to log game scores)
- "track basketball" (to track player progress)
- NOT "basketball player development analytics software"

---

### Test Keywords (Real Words People Use)

**High Probability (similar intent to winners):**

| Keyword | Why | Target CPA | Bid | Budget |
|---------|-----|-----------|-----|--------|
| basketball stats | Core feature, simple word | <$12 | $0.45 | $3 |
| basketball score | Coaches logging scores | <$12 | $0.40 | $2 |
| track basketball | Tracking angle (stats/progress) | <$12 | $0.40 | $2 |
| basketball tracker | Same as above, common phrasing | <$12 | $0.45 | $2 |

**Medium Probability (broader intent, test cheap):**

| Keyword | Why | Target CPA | Bid | Budget |
|---------|-----|-----------|-----|--------|
| basketball app stats | Phrase for stats tracking | <$15 | $0.35 | $1 |
| score keeper basketball | Coaches tracking scores | <$15 | $0.35 | $1 |

**Competitor Keywords (Defensive, very small budget):**

| Keyword | Why | Target CPA | Bid | Budget |
|---------|-----|-----------|-----|--------|
| homecourt app | Competitor defense | <$15 | $0.40 | $1 |
| basketball video app | For video feature angle | <$15 | $0.40 | $1 |

## Part 3: Campaign Structure (Exact Match Only, No Discovery)

### Campaign: AU - CourtLab - Exact Match
**Daily Budget: $25**

```
AD GROUP 1: Proven Winners ($22/day)
├─ basketball training (exact match) | Bid: $0.90 | Daily: $12
└─ basketball drills (exact match) | Bid: $0.80 | Daily: $10

AD GROUP 2: Test Terms ($3/day)
├─ basketball stats (exact match) | Bid: $0.45 | Daily: $1.50
├─ basketball score (exact match) | Bid: $0.40 | Daily: $0.75
└─ track basketball (exact match) | Bid: $0.40 | Daily: $0.75

REMOVED PERMANENTLY:
├─ ❌ basketball app (pause or cut to $0.30)
├─ ❌ aau basketball (zero converts)
└─ ❌ All 13 zero-impression keywords (delete)
```

### Why Exact Match Only

**Exact Match** = User searches EXACT phrase you bid on
- "basketball training" shows only for "basketball training" search
- More expensive per click BUT higher quality (right intent)

**Broad Match** = Shows for similar/related searches
- "basketball training" shows for "basketball drill", "basketball workout", "how to train basketball"
- Cheaper BUT wastes budget on wrong intent

**Your Data Says:** Quality > quantity. 13 keywords with zero impressions prove broad match waste.

## Part 4: Daily Monitoring & Weekly Optimization

### Daily Check (1 minute)
```
□ Impressions today: ___
□ Taps today: ___
□ Installs today: ___
□ Spend today: ___
□ CPA trending: ___
```

### Weekly Optimization Rules

**If test keyword gets <0.5 taps/day for 7 days:**
- ❌ PAUSE it (waste of budget)
- Keep proven winners running
- Don't test more keywords until winners prove out

**If test keyword gets 1+ taps/day:**
- ✅ KEEP it, monitor for installs
- If 20%+ tap-to-install rate: PROMOTE to $2/day budget
- If 0% tap-to-install: Keep testing for 14 days total

**If CPA trending under $12:**
- ✅ GREEN LIGHT to scale
- Increase proven winners bids (+10%)
- Add 2-3 new test keywords

**If CPA trending $12-15:**
- ⚠️ HOLD strategy
- Focus on test keyword performance
- Don't scale yet

**If CPA trending >$15:**
- ❌ PAUSE test keywords
- Focus budget on proven winners only
- Investigate: Is listing updated? App quality issue?

---

## Part 5: App Store Listing (Critical)

### Current Listing
- **Title:** "CourtLab Basketball Trainer"
- **Subtitle:** "Youth Skills, Drills & Stats"
- **App ID:** 6757304855

### Recommended Update
**Subtitle:** "Basketball Stats & Training" (30 chars)
- Aligns with: "basketball training", "basketball stats", "basketball score"
- Removes: "youth" (nobody searches this)
- Includes: "stats" (core feature people search for)

### Why This Matters
When someone searches "basketball training":
- Apple looks at subtitle
- Sees "Basketball Stats & Training"
- Match found → higher quality score → your ad ranks better
- Better rank → better CTR → lower CPA

---

## Part 8: What NOT to Do

### ❌ Don't Add These Keywords (Proven Dead)

From your live campaigns, these got ZERO impressions:
- ❌ "basketball combine timer" — nobody searches this
- ❌ "basketball player development app" — too niche
- ❌ "youth basketball" — nobody uses "youth"
- ❌ "basketball coaching" — not a real search
- ❌ "basketball drills coaching" — too specific

**Don't add variations of dead keywords.** If the base keyword doesn't exist ("youth basketball"), variations won't either.

### ❌ Don't Use Broad Match
Your $20.65 on "basketball app" (174 impressions, 0 converts) suggests broad matching is wasting money. Stick to exact match only.

### ❌ Don't Test Too Many Keywords at Once
Test 3-5 keywords per week max. Otherwise you can't tell which is working.

### ❌ Don't Scale Budget Without <$12 CPA Proof
Stick to $25/day until you prove winners. Don't guess.
