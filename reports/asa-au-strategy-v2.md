# Apple Search Ads AU Strategy v2 - Real Data Driven
**CourtLab Basketball Trainer - Australian Market**

---

## Executive Summary

**Critical Finding:** Our keyword research was wrong. Coaches and parents don't search niche terms on App Store. They search **simple, broad terms**.

**Real Data from Live Campaigns (Feb 2-8, 2026):**

**AU Campaign (18 keywords, $20.65):**
- "basketball app" = ONLY winner (174 impressions, 2 taps, 0 installs)
- 15 out of 18 keywords = ZERO impressions
- All niche terms ("combine timer", "player development", "coaching drills") = dead
- Keywords with "youth", "kids", "junior", "coaching" = zero searches

**Global Campaign (22 keywords, $46.25):**
- "basketball training" = BEST (24 imp, 6 taps, 2 installs, $14.77 CPA, 25% tap-to-install)
- "basketball drills" = 2nd (44 imp, 2 taps, 1 install, $10.80 CPA)
- "aau basketball" = 35 impressions but no converts
- Everything else = dead/near-dead

**Lesson:** Volume is in simple, broad terms. Not in specialized niches.

## Part 1: What Actually Works (Based on Real Data)

### WINNERS (Proven in Campaigns)

**1. "basketball training"**
- Impressions (Global): 24
- Taps: 6
- Installs: 2
- CPA: $14.77
- Tap-to-Install Rate: 25% (excellent)
- Status: **PROVEN WINNER** — Only keyword with solid conversion rate
- Why: Broad intent, high conversion quality
- Recommendation: **BID UP** ($0.70-0.90)

**2. "basketball drills"**
- Impressions (Global): 44
- Taps: 2
- Installs: 1
- CPA: $10.80
- Tap-to-Install Rate: 50% (excellent)
- Status: **PROVEN WINNER** — Best CPA, highest conversion rate
- Why: High volume, good conversion quality
- Recommendation: **BID UP** ($0.60-0.80)

**3. "basketball app"**
- Impressions (AU): 174
- Taps: 2
- Installs: 0
- CPA: Infinite (no converts yet)
- Tap-to-Install Rate: 0%
- Status: **HIGH VOLUME, ZERO CONVERTS** — Too broad, wrong audience
- Why: Generic searchers (casual players, not coaches/stats-focused)
- Recommendation: **TEST WITH LOWER BID** ($0.30-0.40) OR SKIP

**4. "aau basketball"**
- Impressions (Global): 35
- Taps: 0
- Installs: 0
- CPA: N/A
- Status: **DEAD** — No interest despite volume
- Recommendation: **PAUSE**

### CONFIRMED DEAD (Zero Impressions or Taps)

These keywords got zero or near-zero searches. They're NOT keywords people use:
- ❌ "basketball combine timer" — ZERO impressions (my research was wrong)
- ❌ "combine times tracker" — ZERO impressions
- ❌ "basketball player development app" — ZERO impressions
- ❌ "basketball coach app" — ZERO impressions
- ❌ "youth basketball training" — ZERO impressions
- ❌ "basketball coaching drills" — ZERO impressions
- ❌ Any keyword with "youth", "kids", "junior", "coaching", "combine" = DEAD

**Insight:** Nobody on App Store is searching these niche terms. They're either:
1. Using specific brand searches ("homecourt", "sideline")
2. Using simple broad terms ("basketball", "basketball training", "basketball drills", "basketball stats")
3. Not searching at all (finding apps via recommendations, reviews, browsing)

## Part 4: Daily Monitoring & Optimization

### Daily Checklist
```
□ Check impressions by keyword
□ Check taps by keyword
□ Check tap-to-install rate by keyword
□ Calculate CPA by keyword
□ Note any new keywords from Search Match
□ Track total daily spend (target: $25-30)
```

### Weekly Decision Rules

**If CTR improving in Tier 1 keywords:**
- Tier 1 (Proven): ✅ INCREASE BID ($0.90-1.00)
- Tier 2-3: ✅ HOLD

**If CTR flat/declining in Tier 2-3:**
- Test keywords getting <1 tap/day: ❌ PAUSE
- Test keywords with 0 installs after 500+ impressions: ❌ PAUSE
- Competitor keywords with 0 taps: ❌ PAUSE

**If CPA trending under $8:**
- ✅ SCALE - Increase daily budget to $40-50/day
- ✅ ADD MORE KEYWORDS from Tier 2
- ✅ INCREASE BIDS on Tier 1 by 10-15%

**If CPA trending $8-12:**
- ✅ HOLD STRATEGY - Continue monitoring
- ✅ OPTIMIZE AD COPY - Test different headlines
- ✅ WATCH SEARCH MATCH - Any winners?

**If CPA trending >$12:**
- ⚠️ PAUSE Tier 2 keywords (highest risk)
- ⚠️ FOCUS on Tier 1 only ($15/day budget)
- ⚠️ INVESTIGATE - Is app store listing updated? Are ads showing?

**If Search Match finds winner:**
- ✅ NOTE the keyword
- ✅ ADD as exact match keyword with $0.60 bid
- ✅ MONITOR for 3 days
- ✅ If converting, promote to Tier 1

## Part 5: What We Got Wrong (The Research Failure)

### Why My Original Keywords Were Wrong

1. **I assumed niche search behavior** 
   - Coaches search for "basketball combine timer"
   - Reality: They search "basketball training" and "basketball drills"
   - They want general tools, not specialized combine-only tools

2. **I overestimated App Store search sophistication**
   - Thought: "Coaches know exactly what they want, will search specific terms"
   - Reality: People search broad terms and expect app to match

3. **I didn't have live data**
   - Thought: Search volume estimates would reflect real behavior
   - Reality: Live campaign data beats theories every time
   - 174 impressions for "basketball app" (not in my top 30) > all my "combine" keywords combined

4. **Keyword research ≠ App Store behavior**
   - Google Trends data doesn't apply to App Store search
   - Competitor apps don't reveal their keyword strategies
   - Only real data matters

### Lesson for Future Strategy
- **Start with live campaign data** (not research)
- **Test simple, broad terms first** (not niche)
- **Let Search Match discover** (not manual keyword building)
- **Scale what works** (not what theory suggests)

---

## Part 6: App Store Listing Alignment

**Current Subtitle:** "Youth Skills, Drills & Stats"

**Problem:** Aligned with research keywords ("skills", "drills") but not with actual search behavior

**New Recommendation (Option A - Broad):**
"Basketball Stats & Drills Tracker"
- Includes: stats, drills, tracker
- Aligns with: "basketball stats", "basketball tracker"

**New Recommendation (Option B - Training Focus):**
"Basketball Training & Stats"
- Includes: training, stats
- Aligns with: "basketball training", "basketball stats"

**New Recommendation (Option C - Keep Current):**
"Youth Skills, Drills & Stats"
- Still works for: training, drills, stats keywords
- Not ideal but functional

**Recommendation:** Go with Option B ("Basketball Training & Stats")
- Matches top-performing keyword "basketball training"
- Includes "stats" for secondary keyword
- Removes "youth" (nobody searching "youth basketball" on App Store)
- Keeps it simple (30 chars max)

---

## Part 7: Search Match Strategy

### Why Search Match

**What it does:**
- Apple AI finds related keywords you haven't bid on
- Automatically creates matches for searches similar to your keywords
- Helps discover keywords you didn't think of

**How to use:**
1. Start with $3/day budget
2. Monitor impressions/taps weekly
3. If any keyword gets consistent taps, note it
4. Add as exact match keyword if performing
5. Scale to $5/day once you trust the results

**Example:**
- You bid on "basketball training"
- Search Match finds "basketball workouts", "basketball practice", "workout app"
- If "basketball workouts" gets 3+ taps, add as exact match with $0.70 bid

**Risk:** Low (conservative $3 budget, just discovery)

### Week 3-4 (Feb 24 - Mar 9)
**Goal: Scale or pivot**

- [ ] If CPA <$8: Scale to $50-75/day, add Tier 2 keywords
- [ ] If CPA $8-12: Hold $28/day, test new ad variations

- [ ] Target: 200+ installs by end of Month 1

### Month 2 (Mar 10 - Apr 9)

## Summary: What Changed from v1

| Factor | v1 | v2 | Why |
|--------|----|----|-----|
| Keywords | 30 (research-based) | 8 (real-data-based) | Real data shows volume in broad terms only |
| "combine timer" | Tier 1 high bid | DELETED | Zero impressions in real campaign |
| "basketball training" | Not in top 10 | Tier 1 high bid | Proven winner: 25% TTR, $14.77 CPA |
| "basketball drills" | Tier 2 | Tier 1 high bid | Best performer: 50% TTR, $10.80 CPA |
| Search Match | Not mentioned | Core strategy | Discover keywords you haven't thought of |
| Budget | $1,000/day | $28/day | Real constraint + proof-of-concept approach |
| Focus | Broad expansion | Laser-focused on winners | Test proven keywords first, scale if working |

---

## Bottom Line

**Old approach:** Build perfect keyword list from theory → fail
**New approach:** Use real campaign data → bid on winners → discover via Search Match → scale what works

You already have the data. I was ignoring it.

**Winners from your live campaigns:**
1. basketball training (25% TTR)
2. basketball drills (50% TTR)

**Test:** basketball stats, basketball tracker, basketball score + Search Match discovery

**Budget:** $28/day ($20 proven, $8 testing, $3 discovery)

**Timeline:** 7 days to prove <$10 CPA, then scale.

---

**Ready to launch when you update the App Store subtitle.**
