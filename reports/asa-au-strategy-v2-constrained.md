# Apple Search Ads AU Strategy - REVISED (Constrained Budget)
**CourtLab Basketball Trainer - Australian Market**

---

## CRITICAL CORRECTION

**Original Strategy:** Assumed $1,000/day budget
**Actual Budget:** $20-30/day
**Approach:** Top 5 keywords only, prove <$10 CPA before scaling

---

## Executive Summary

**Current Campaign Performance (Feb 2-8, 2026):**
- Impressions: 331
- Taps: 3
- Installs: 0
- Spend: $20.65
- CTR: 0.91%
- **Critical Issue:** No conversions with current messaging

**App Store Listing (VERIFIED):**
- Title: "CourtLab Basketball Trainer" ✅ (good)
- Subtitle: "Youth Skills, Drills & Stats" ❌ (GENERIC — no "combine", "verified", "timer", "coach")
- App ID: 6757304855
- Version: 2.0 (shipped 3 days ago)
- Status: LIVE on US App Store ✅

**Root Cause of 0.91% CTR:**
Subtitle is generic. Apple Search Ads quality score heavily tied to keyword relevance in metadata. Searchers looking for "basketball combine timer" see "Youth Skills, Drills & Stats" and don't click because it's not messaging-aligned.

**Solution:** 
1. Update subtitle immediately: "Verified Combine Times & Stats"
2. Focus ASA on top 5 high-intent keywords only
3. Bid conservatively ($0.50-1.00 to stay under $10 CPA)
4. Prove performance before scaling budget

## PART 2: DAILY BUDGET ALLOCATION ($20-30/day)

### Conservative Strategy (Prove <$10 CPA First)

```
Total Daily Budget: $25/day (testing)

Keyword #1: "basketball combine timer"
  Daily Budget: $8/day
  Bid: $1.00
  Expected: 8-10 taps/day, 2-3 installs
  Target CPA: <$8

Keyword #2: "basketball stats app"
  Daily Budget: $6/day
  Bid: $0.60
  Expected: 10-15 taps/day, 1-2 installs
  Target CPA: <$10

Keyword #3: "combine times tracker"
  Daily Budget: $5/day
  Bid: $1.00
  Expected: 5-6 taps/day, 1-2 installs
  Target CPA: <$8

Keyword #4: "basketball coach app"
  Daily Budget: $4/day
  Bid: $0.70
  Expected: 5-7 taps/day, 0.5-1 install
  Target CPA: <$10

Keyword #5: "basketball combine australia"
  Daily Budget: $2/day
  Bid: $0.85
  Expected: 2-3 taps/day, 0.5-1 install
  Target CPA: <$9

─────────────────────────────────────────
TOTAL: $25/day
Expected Daily: 30-40 taps, 4-8 installs
Target Aggregate CPA: <$6.25 (if 4 installs) to <$3.13 (if 8 installs)
```

### If Performance Proves Out (<$10 CPA):
- Scale to $50/day (add 5 more keywords)
- Then to $100/day (add 10 more keywords)
- Then to $500/day (full strategy)

### If Performance Disappoints (>$15 CPA):
- Focus only on #1 + #3 (combine-specific)
- Increase bids for those two keywords
- Pause #2, #4, #5 temporarily
- Revisit App Store listing optimization

---

## PART 3: APP STORE LISTING FIX (IMMEDIATE)

### Current Problem
**Subtitle:** "Youth Skills, Drills & Stats" 
- ❌ Generic (every basketball app says this)
- ❌ No "combine", "verified", "timer", "coach" keywords
- ❌ Doesn't align with ASA keywords
- ❌ Apple Search Ads quality score = LOW

**Why This Hurts ASA:**
When someone searches "basketball combine timer", Apple's algorithm checks:
1. Does the app's title/subtitle mention "combine"? NO → Lower quality score
2. Does the app's description mention "timer"? MAYBE → Unclear
3. Does the app's keywords field mention "verified"? UNKNOWN
4. Result: Even if you bid higher, your ad ranks lower = lower CTR = worse CPA

### Recommended Change
**New Subtitle:** "Verified Combine Times & Stats" (30 chars)
- ✅ Includes 3 critical keywords: "verified", "combine", "times"
- ✅ Aligns with ASA keywords #1 and #3
- ✅ Appeals to combine coaches (primary target)
- ✅ Improves App Store quality score

**Impact:**
- Expected CTR improvement: 0.91% → 3-5% (with same bid)
- Expected CPA improvement: Likely <$10 (from current undefined)

## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

1. **Update App Store Subtitle FIRST** 
   - This is the blocker. Do this before launching ads.
   - Subtitle change takes 2-4 hours to reflect

2. **Monitor CTR Daily**
   - 0.91% was with generic subtitle
   - Should improve 3-5x once subtitle updated
   - If not improving within 3 days, something else is wrong

3. **Prove <$10 CPA Before Scaling**
   - Don't add budget until Week 2 data shows success
   - Conservative approach: validate model first, then scale
   - CPA >$15 = pause and reassess

4. **Don't Touch Global Campaign**
   - Global is converting well (7.64% CTR, 3 installs)
   - AU is the problem (different keywords, different messaging)
   - Keep them separate

## COMPARISON: V1 Strategy vs V2 Strategy

| Factor | V1 (Original) | V2 (Constrained) | Change |

| Daily Budget | $1,000 | $25 | -97% |
| Keywords | 30 | 5 | -83% |
| Ad Groups | 3 | 1 | Simplified |
| Bid Range | $1.00-4.00 | $0.50-1.20 | Conservative |
| Target CPA | <$30 | <$10 | More aggressive |
| Timeline | 90 days | 30 days proof-of-concept | Faster decision |
| Focus | Broad expansion | Top keywords only | Laser-focused |

**Key Difference:** V1 assumed large budget; V2 proves viability with small budget first.
