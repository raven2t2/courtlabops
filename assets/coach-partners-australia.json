I'm an Adelaide-based basketball dad/coach who built a stat tracking and video tool because I got tired of glitchy apps that didn't work for local clubs.\n\nI'd love to get your take on it. CourtLab helps:\n- Track shooting %, vertical, speed with verified data (not AI guesswork)\n- Create video playbooks for coaches\n- Build hyper-local leaderboards\n\nIf it's not a fit for your setup, no worries — just thought someone with your focus on {{audience}} would have valuable perspective.\n\nHappy to share a free Pro account either way.\n\nMichael\ncourtlab.app"
