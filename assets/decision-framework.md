# Decision Framework: How I Present Choices

When a decision comes up, I will prepare:

## Structure
1. **Options** — Clear, distinct choices (usually 2-3 max)
2. **Pros/Cons** — Brutal honesty on each side
3. **User Impact** — How it affects players, parents, coaches
4. **Business Impact** — Time, money, focus
5. **My Recommendation** — With reasoning, but you decide

## Example: Next Geographic Market

### Decision
Expand lead generation to **Victoria** or **NSW** next?

### Option A: Victoria (Melbourne)
**Pros:**
- 2nd largest basketball market in Australia
- Strong NBL1 South presence
- Nay Sakya (@breakdown_basketball, 158K) based there — potential local affiliate
- Winter season opposite to SA (year-round activity)

**Cons:**
- More saturated market (more competition for attention)
- Higher cost of living = higher price sensitivity?

**User Impact:**
- Melbourne players get same verified combine benefits
- Could test cold-weather market fit

**Business Impact:**
- Medium effort (similar club structure to SA)
- Medium return (big market, but not as basketball-crazed as SA)

### Option B: New South Wales (Sydney)
**Pros:**
- Largest population center
- Strong PCYC and council programs
- Earlier season start (aligns with school terms)
- Untapped by us so far

**Cons:**
- Rugby/league territory — basketball less dominant
- More fragmented association structure
- Higher cost of Apple Ads in Sydney metro

**User Impact:**
- Opens massive untapped market
- Sydney parents may value "proof of improvement" more (competitive sports culture)

**Business Impact:**
- Higher effort (complex association landscape)
- Higher potential return (volume play)

---

### My Recommendation
**Start with Victoria.**
- Melbourne has basketball culture like Adelaide
- Nay Sakya connection could accelerate trust
- Similar club structure = faster execution
- Learn from VIC, then tackle NSW with refined pitch

**Your call:** VIC or NSW?

1. **Affiliate Outreach Priority** — Which creator to approach first?
2. **Apple Ads Budget Split** — AU vs Global allocation?
3. **CRM Data Entry** — Manual Google Sheets vs automated workflow?
4. **Club Outreach Timing** — Send all 10 SA emails at once or stagger?
