Heard you're also helping organize the Easter Classic, which is huge.\n\nI'm Michael from CourtLab. We built this for coaches exactly like you who track player improvement seriously. Instead of spiral notebooks or Excel sheets, you get verified shooting stats + film on tap.\n\nGiven the scale of your U18 program, might be worth a quick look.\n\ncourtlab.app\n\nCheers,\nMichael",
