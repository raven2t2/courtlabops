      "body": "Hi [Secretary Name],\n\n[PERSONALIZED OPENER - Pick one based on research:]\n- \"Saw you run the Easter Classic — biggest tournament in SA\"\n- \"60+ district teams is serious scale\"\n- \"Your Hoops & Her program is impressive\"\n- \"NBL1 Central team with pro player pipeline\"\n- \"[Club Name] has incredible community presence\"\n\n[PROBLEM STATEMENT]\nVolunteer coaches managing stats manually takes hours. No consistent coaching language across teams. Parents don't see their child's progress.\n\n[SOLUTION]\nCourtLab automates player development tracking. Three taps per coach:\n1. Check attendance\n2. Tag skills worked on (pre-set list)\n3. Done — system generates parent update\n\nResult: Coaches save 2+ hours/week. Parents get weekly clarity. Club sees trends by age group.\n\n[SOCIAL PROOF]\nBuilt in Adelaide. Already used by [mention visible clubs if applicable]. \nFounding Club rate: $2,450/year (limited to first 10 SA district clubs).\n\n[CTA]\nWorth a 15-minute demo this week?\n\ncourtlab.app\n\nCheers,\nMichael\nFounder, CourtLab",

Your post about [specific piece: 'player development' OR 'coaching tips' OR 'basketball training'] hit different — [why it resonates: 'honest take' OR 'exactly what coaches need' OR 'practical advice'].\n\nI built CourtLab because I got tired of basketball apps that don't work. No AI guesswork. Just verified combine data.\n\nYour audience [specific reason they'd benefit from CourtLab based on their niche]:\n- If coaching-focused: \"Players need reliable stats, not camera angles\"\n- If content-focused: \"Story angle of underdog 'undeniable proof'\"\n- If media-focused: \"Pathway data is hard to find for prospects\"\n- If trainer-focused: \"Clients want proof of improvement\"\n\nNot asking for anything yet.
